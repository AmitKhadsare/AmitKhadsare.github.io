      <p class="lead">At Columbia Care Home, "home" is a deliberate design decision—not an afterthought. Combining the clinical insight of our founders (licensed physical therapists) with residential architecture, our home is crafted so that every hallway, window, and communal seat supports mobility, builds social connection, and preserves dignity. This article walks you through the building's architecture, interior choices, functional design, and outdoor spaces—with exact visual landmarks for a virtual or in-person visit.</p>

      <h2>Architectural Overview: Layout That Respects Autonomy</h2>
      <p>The arrival sequence sets the tone. Our front entry is intentionally domestic in scale—a covered porch that avoids institutional grandeur and invites a calm transition from street to home.</p>
      
      <p>Inside, the circulation is designed for legibility. Short corridors, clear sightlines, and consistent flooring reduce cognitive load for residents and simplify staff workflows. Room clusters are organized around shared living and dining "neighborhoods" to encourage incidental social interaction while preserving privacy.</p>

      <p>Therapy and staff zones are strategically placed adjacent to living areas, allowing for quick support without interrupting the natural flow of resident life.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Our foyer offers a warm welcome, helping visitors and residents feel instantly at home.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Interior Design: Warmth, Light & Intimacy</h2>
      <p>We use a palette of soft, warm neutrals—creams, warm grays, and muted greens—layered with textures like woven upholstery and wood veneers. This creates a domestic aesthetic that feels cozy rather than clinical. Contrast is used carefully, such as floor-to-wall thresholds, to aid safety and visibility.</p>

      <figure class="my-10">
        <img src="/images/blog/living-room-seating.jpg" alt="Cozy communal living room with multiple seating clusters and large windows" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg" />
        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Communal living room: small seating clusters encourage conversation and reduce noise.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Daylight is a priority. Large windows and skylights bring sunlight deep into communal rooms, while window seats and planted sills encourage residents to spend time by the natural light. Furniture is residential in scale—no hospital loungers here. Seating is arranged in small clusters to promote intimate conversation, using non-glare surfaces and tactile textiles to reduce overstimulation.</p>

      <p>Acoustics are managed through soft furnishings and area rugs, reducing reverberation to create calm conversation levels without isolation.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Dining area designed for family-style meals and social dining.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Resident Rooms: Privacy With Accessible Independence</h2>
      <p>Our private and semi-private rooms are designed with uncluttered circulation zones and clear bed-to-bath paths. Built-in storage, shelving, and soft-close cabinetry allow residents to bring personal items and photos—critical for a sense of place.</p>

      <figure class="my-10">
        <img src="/images/blog/bedroom-suite.jpg" alt="Private resident bedroom with accessible clearances and warm lighting" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg" />
        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Resident room: balance of privacy, comfort and access for mobility devices.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Lighting includes ambient, task, and night-light layers with reachable controls to support circadian rhythms and reduce fall risks. Accessible detailing is everywhere: 32–36 inch doorways, 60-inch turning radii, lever handles, and low thresholds with non-slip flooring.</p>

      <h2>Therapy & Mobility Spaces: Movement Built Into the Plan</h2>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-emerald-600 pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-emerald-50 italic text-emerald-900 rounded-r-lg">
        "As physical therapists, we designed this home around movement and dignity."
      </blockquote>

      <p>Our dedicated therapy room features low-shelf storage, open floor area for gait training, mirrored walls for posture work, and space for one-on-one consultation. But therapy extends beyond the gym—mini-therapy zones near living areas encourage incidental activity.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Flooring transitions from shock-absorbing resilient material in therapy zones to warm, residential flooring in living spaces. Staff stations are placed to monitor these areas without intruding, enabling timely assistance during transfers.</p>

      <h2>Safety by Design: Subtle, Effective, Respectful</h2>
      <p>Safety features protect residents without feeling medical. Bathrooms feature roll-in showers with bench seats, handheld sprayers, and discreet grab bars that match hardware finishes. We use curbless thresholds and properly rated slip-resistant tile.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Bathroom design supports independence while minimizing fall risk.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Night visibility is enhanced by low-level path lighting and motion-sensing night lights. Emergency systems include quick-access nurse call points and unobtrusive monitoring, while wayfinding is supported by clear signage and color cues.</p>

      <h2>Community & Common Spaces: Life Happens Here</h2>
      <p>Flexible activity rooms convert from crafts to exercise classes, while small social nooks offer places for quiet interaction. Dining is treated as a ritual, with design supporting both large gatherings and small family meals.</p>

      <figure class="my-10">
        <img src="/images/blog/therapy-activity-room.jpg" alt="Multi-use activity room with movable seating and storage" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg" />
        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Activity spaces adapt for crafts, group exercise and family events.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Outdoor & Landscape Design: Garden Therapy & Gentle Movement</h2>
      <p>Our therapeutic landscaping includes raised planters, sensory gardens, and shaded seating. Paths are even and non-slip with gentle slopes, encouraging walkability. Landscape buffers create private outdoor moments while framing views from common rooms.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-center text-stone-500 mt-3 text-sm italic">Outdoor spaces promote calm, fresh air and gentle exercise.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Design Details That Matter</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-8 text-stone-700">
        <li>Use of residential hardware finishes (brass/bronze) to reduce clinical feel.</li>
        <li>Low-glare lighting and dimmable fixtures in rooms.</li>
        <li>Flooring contrast thresholds for safe step recognition.</li>
        <li>Furniture with armrests and appropriate seat heights for transfers.</li>
        <li>Integrated storage for personal items close to bedside.</li>
        <li>Clear emergency wayfinding and staff staging zones.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Virtual Tour & Remote Discovery</h2>
      <p>The virtual tour is a window into everyday life here and a first step before a site visit. We invite you to explore the front entry, main living room, therapy gym, private rooms, and outdoor walks to capture the essence of our home.</p>
